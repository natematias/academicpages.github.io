This large lecture course sets out to create intellectual pathways for students interested in technology and society questions by supporting them to carry out a scavenger hunt in the world and in their lived experience. As they encounter examples and challenging questions about Communication & Technology, we will support students to learn about scholarly concepts that can help them understand, reason, and take action as designers, researchers, and citizens.

The course, which is required for many Communication and Information Science majors, unfolds in three self-contained units that expose students to a widening circle of questions and concepts: design, psychology, and sociology.

Starting in 2023, we are providing an optional opportunity for students to participate in a class-wide research project having to do algorithms used to screen job applicants.
