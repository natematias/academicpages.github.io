title: 'Fundraiser: Climbing a virtual Everest with the Global Voices Community'
---
In a world of conflict and competition, cultivating understanding across human differences is difficult, necessary, and so beautiful. This summer, I'm riding my bicycle up the equivalent of Mount Everest on a journey of connection and understanding. As I do so, I invite you to follow along and donate to help Global Voices meet their goal of raising $250,000 to continue the crucial cross-border reporting, translation and support of underrepresented communities they’ve been doing for the past 20 years.
