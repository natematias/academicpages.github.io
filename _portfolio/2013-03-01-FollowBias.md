Networked gatekeepers on social media increasingly influence
which people and groups receive media attention. Many
unknowingly direct much greater attention to men than to
women. Can technologies support these gatekeepers to follow
their own values of equality? 

As part of my Master's thesis, Sarah Szalavitz and I created FollowBias, an app that gives people personalized feedback on the percentage of women they follow on Twitter and tracks whether they change their behavior. We published results from the FollowBias project at CSCW 2017:
