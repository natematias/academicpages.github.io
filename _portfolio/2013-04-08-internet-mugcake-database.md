In 2013, <a href="http://www.ireneros.com">Irene Ros</a> and I created the <a href="https://natematias.com/proj/mugcakes/">Internet Mugcake Database (IMDB)</a>. It was one of my first citizen science projects:

> This is what happens when busy people who love cake come together. They spend inordinate amount of time using the scientific method to sort out how to shorten the time span between them and cake. Also microwaves.

> This is where YOU come in. Not only are you here to figure out how to make your next mugcake. You are here to grow the knowledge base of mugcake making. FOR SCIENCE!

The IMDB, which was mostly created by Irene, relies on some cool javascript libraries she created that allow you to create a public website by editing Google Sheets. <a href="https://github.com/iros/mugcakes">The mugcake archive code is on github</a>.
