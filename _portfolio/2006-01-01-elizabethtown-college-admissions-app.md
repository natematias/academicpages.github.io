In 2006, I was asked to complete software behind the <a href="http://etown.edu/">Elizabethtown College</a> online application, which had been prototyped by <a href="http://www.linkedi<p>n.com/in/snehesh">Snehesh Shrestha</a>. My role in this C# .NET project involved significantly refactoring the application software to:</p>
<ul><li> Automatically correlate the XML model with the database definitions so admissions staff could add and remove conditional fields with ease</li>
<li> Generalise the integration between the application views and the SQL server instance via the XML+XSLT definitions </li></ul>
<p>A descendant of this application system is still in use at Elizabethtown College as of December 2010.</p>
