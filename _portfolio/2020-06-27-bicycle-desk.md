title: "Bicycle Desk"

On "normal" days when there's not a global pandemic and I'm able to use my office, I like to bicycle up the hill to Cornell for my morning commute. During the pandemic, I kept up my fitness with a bicycle desk that I upgraded with a flexible ipad mount for a second screeen. Unfortunately, FitDesk no longer manufactures the bicycle trainer desk that I use. If you want a bike desk of your own, check out [this post by Thomas Gerlach](http://www.thomasgerlach.com/2016/10/best-indoor-trainer-cycling-stand-desk.html), which lists several options that were still for sale in the summer of 2020.
