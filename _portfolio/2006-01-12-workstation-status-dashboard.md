<p>During the summer of 2006, I developed a graphical dashboard for monitoring the hundreds of student workstations used by students and faculty members at Elizabethtown College. This software would notify us if workstations were running, and if they had crashed. I think it also permitted remote reset.</p>

<p>Sadly, I don't have a screenshot of the UI, which presented a spatial map of room layouts, showing the workstations' arrangement in the room, color-coding the status of each computer. A sysadmin could then know the status of the network at a glance.</p>
