From 2012 through 2014, I facilitated <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/category/1book140/">the Atlanticâ€™s Twitter book club</a> 1book140, a reading club with over 125,000 followers:

* Picking themes, crowdsourcing suggestions, organizing votes, and writing about the chosen books in The Atlantic
* Facilitating online discussions about books chosen by the community
* Arranging and facilitating Q&As with notable authors
* Creating novel software to track conversations about books online

I thoroughly enjoyed my time writing and organizing the book club, and I still miss it. Many of the facilitation skills I gained in 1book140 became useful in my research with large-scale online communities.
