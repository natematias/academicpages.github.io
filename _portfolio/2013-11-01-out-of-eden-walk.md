In 2013, Ethan Zuckerman and I established the initial social media account and practices for Paul Salopek's <a href="https://learn.outofedenwalk.com">Out of Eden Walk</a>, an amazing journey on foot with the New York Times and National Geographic from East Africa, across Asia, and down the American continents. Designing the campaign with Paul and Ethan was a great joy, and I continue to keep up with Paul on his journeys.
