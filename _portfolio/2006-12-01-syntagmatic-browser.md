<p>While studying the language of Shakespeare in my first year of postgraduate study at the University of Cambridge, I envisioned "The Syntagmatic Browser." Drawing from the theories of Saussure, this new kind of thesaurus visualisation would create associations among the contexts of words rather than the words themselves. </p>
<p>Although I developed a prototype in <a href="http://gzigzag.sourceforge.net/">GZigZag</a>, I never built the software. I really ought to someday. It would be a fantastic utility for lexicographers and literary scholars.</p>
<p>It wasn't until much later that I came across <a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu/fsnlp/">Statistical Natural Language Processing</a> in my roles at Texperts, Dressipi, and TouchType. </p>
