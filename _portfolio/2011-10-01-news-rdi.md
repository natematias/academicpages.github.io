<p>In this demo, we visualised the last 20 years of New York Times national and international coverage, with data from the Linguistic Data Consortium.</p>

<p>After writing a Processing demo to display the data, we embedded the display into a news box donated by <a href="http://www.berkshireeagle.com/" rel="nofollow">The Berkshire Eagle</a>, which Ethan drove all the way from Western Mass. We wrote software for the Arduino to let viewers control the visualization using a dial on the front of the box</p>

<p>The photo on the right shows Matt Stempeck and I demo-ing it at our very first Media Lab Member Liaison meeting, in 2011.</p>
