<p>Our Things is a simple messaging and analytics platform for coordinating community use of a shared resource, such as a well, oven,  or laundry machine.</p>

<p>The analytics is incredibly important; in addition to knowing about the current status of a shared resource, we can use knowledge about usage patterns to make better decisions.</p>

<p>By making a feed of previous activities available via iCal, Our Things helps communities compare actual usage of a shared resource against usage anticipated by those who have made reservations.</p>
