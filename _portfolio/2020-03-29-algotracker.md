Since 2016, CAT Lab has taken ongoing snapshots of redditâ€™s algorithms every 2-3 minutes. We created this dashboard to inform the design of our collaborations with reddit communities on COVID-19 public health research. We have made the dashboard, data, and code public for researchers and practitioners who study the role of algorithms in society.
