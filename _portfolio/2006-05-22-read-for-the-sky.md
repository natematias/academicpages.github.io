 <p>In 2006, the <a href="http://www.whitakercenter.org/">Whitaker Center for Science and the Arts</a> and <a href="http://www.patriot-news.com/">The Patriot News</a> sponsored a sculpture I created with <a href="http://www.davittidarling.com/">Susan Darling</a>, and had it placed on the PA State Capitol steps for the summer.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, neither Susan nor I ever heard what was done with our sculpture after the exhibition ended. We were never given a chance to properly disassemble it.</p>
<p>I loved working with Susan and regret that living in different places prevents us from doing further work together.</p>
