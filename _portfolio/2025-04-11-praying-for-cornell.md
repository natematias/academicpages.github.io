Join Cornell's Christian community on **Wednesday April 16 at 6:15pm** for an evening of prayer for our university, for students and academics at risk across the country, and for the future of learning and knowledge in the United States.

* **[RSVP and share your prayer requests](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdKQgjMdLFeHqigEMaJsCcEkdnWumXPz-6dbCxHQtYNTkPVHw/viewform?usp=header)**

From scientists working on vaccines to humanities scholars tracing our shared past, people across Cornell participate in the grand endeavor of Psalm 111: "Great are the works of the Lord; studied by all who delight in them."

On April 8th, the US government [promised to freeze $1 Billion in funding](https://www.cornellsun.com/article/2025/04/breaking-trump-administration-freezes-more-than-1-billion-in-funding-for-cornell) from Cornell University. This extraordinary measure has led to substantial fear and uncertainty across campus. Each day brings new reports of [canceled funding](https://www.cornellsun.com/article/2025/02/cornell-11-other-universities-sue-nih-after-multi-million-dollar-grant-cuts-announced), [jobs lost](https://ithacavoice.org/2025/03/cornell-researchers-protest-trump-era-funding-freeze-cuts/), and universities directly threatened with existential cuts ([Penn](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/20/nx-s1-5333675/university-pennsylvania-upenn-trump-suspends-funding-trans-student-athletes), [Columbia](https://apnews.com/article/columbia-research-funding-cuts-antisemitism-palestine-israel-6f5f6a66306ec2467fc346b993e87a50), [Brown](https://www.browndailyherald.com/article/2025/04/trump-administration-set-to-freeze-510-million-of-browns-federal-funding-nyt-reports), [Harvard](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/4/1/trump-review-harvard-funds/), [Princeton](https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/04/princeton-news-adpol-eisgruber-university-concessions-bloomberg-interview), [Johns Hopkins](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/13/johns-hopkins-job-cuts-usaid), and now [Cornell](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/us/politics/cornell-northwestern-university-funds-trump.html?unlocked_article_code=1.-U4.4P-7.ZopQRl9t5R_E&smid=url-share)).

In response, **we are doing what Christians have done for thousands of years to face adversity: turning to God in prayer for refuge and strength.**

In this prayer meeting, join Christians from across Cornell and the wider community to learn about the current situation, pray for the future of our university, pray for those who fear for their livelihoods, and pray for university leaders to find wisdom and courage in difficult times.
