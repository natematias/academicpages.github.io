  <p>In February 2010, I was inivited by the <a href="http://www.anglia.ac.uk/ruskin/en/home/microsites/arc.html">Anglia Research Centre in Digital Culture</a>, to give a talk on what I called "Operational Media," information design which is used to make all sorts of decisions: </p>
<ul><li> what to purchase</li>
<li> how to use our time</li>
<li> how to respond to unfolding combat situations</li>
<li> how to vote</li></ul>

<p>I gave examples of design trends, relating them to business, the open government movement, and computer science. I also highlighted relevant skills for students who want work in this area.</p>
<p>During the lecture, I made available a companion site with additional sources and ideas.</p>

<li> Jussi Parikka <a href="http://www.networkpolitics.org/blogs/jussiparikka/17/february/2010/operational-media-design-and-biopower">blogged about my talk</a>. He said:</li></ul>
<blockquote> Nathan's talk was able to introduce the general idea of computer assisted information retrieval and management which to me was a great way of branding a variety of trends into "operational media". He talked about visualisation of data, augmented reality, filtering of data, expert, crowd and computer assisted information gathering, and a variety of other contexts in which the idea works.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The talk was in providing [sic] really good material on the intertwining of such (bio)political questions in (online) media design.</blockquote>
