 <p>From 2003 to 2005, I was part of the Elizbethtown College Academic Integrity Committee( and co-chair in 04/05 with <a href="http://users.etown.edu/k/kopkok/Kyle_C._Kopko/Welcome.html">Kyle Kopko</a>).  Our role was to train other students in use of sources and promote academic integrity at all levels of the college.</p>
<p>In 2004, we decided to replace an existing series of posters on academic integrity which had been placed throughout the campus. It was the very first marketing campaign I had ever done, and it involved planning, rights management, design, and then organising a team to physically put up the posters. Some of the designs were done collaboratively with Hannah Scott, using a methodology similar to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming">pair programming</a>.</p>
<p>As a group, I am also pleased at the insight we had to market the posters to third parties. They have been a steady fundraiser for this student society the last few years. The entire set is at:</p>

<p>The following examples demonstrate the stylistic range which I developed across the time I served the Academic Integrity Committee.</p>
