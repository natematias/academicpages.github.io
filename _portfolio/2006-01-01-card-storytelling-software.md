<p>In 2005, Clare Hooper developed a wonderful tarot-based storytelling system called <a href="http://storyspinner.ecs.soton.ac.uk/">StorySpinner</a>. She <a href="http://users.ecs.soton.ac.uk/dem/workshops/ht05/papers/Hooper.pdf">presented her research</a> at Hypertext 2005.</p>
<p>The next year, Clare and I prototyped an authoring system for writers of card-based fictions. It has since disappeared in a hard drive crash. </p>

<p>At the time, card-based storytelling was very popular with writers.</p>
<ul><li> Robert Cover wrote <a href="http://grandtextauto.org/2005/11/18/following-robert-coovers-suit/">Heart Suit</a></li>
<li> MouseChief was working on <a href="http://www.mousechief.com/witchs_yarn/index.html">The Witch's Yarn</a></li>
<li> Mark Bernstein had been writing about <a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=504233">Card Shark and Thespis</a></li></ul>
<p>In 2008, Penguin published "<a href="http://wetellstories.co.uk/stories/week6/">The (Former) General In His Labyrinth</a>" by Mohsin Hamid</p>
<p>If you want to write one now, I would suggest <a href="http://undum.com/"><b>Undum</b>: A client-side framework for hypertext interactive fiction games</a>.</p>
