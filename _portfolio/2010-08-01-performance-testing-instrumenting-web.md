<p>In August 2010, I gave a talk at <a href="http://cambridgegeeknights.net/">Cambridge Geek Nights</a> on performance testing &amp; instrumentation of web applications, and how having a good performance test framework helped us out at Texperts during three key moments in the history of our company:</p>
<ul><li> When negotiating our acquisition</li>
<li> When deploying on new hardware clusters into new regions </li>
<li> When scaling our system to handle Super Bowl level traffic</li></ul>

<p>I have put the slides on Slideshare: "<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/natematias/performance-testing-and-instrumenting-the-kgb-sms-service-for-the-super-bowl-6127788">Performance Testing and Instrumenting the KGB SMS Service for the Super Bowl</a>"</p>
<p>My favourite slide: "Why Yes, Our System Architecture *was* a bit like Missile Command."</p>
