In the spring of 2014, Chelsea Barabas and I organized a project called <a href="https://civic.mit.edu/2014/04/18/the-peoples-bot/">The People's Bot</a>, which provided free access to expensive, exclusive events to students and journalists. The project was included as an art project at Theorizing the Web 2014. CHI 2014 sold us a ticket for The People's Bot, and we were successfully able to get in a bunch of people for free. Leon Neyfakh at the Boston Globe wrote a story about telepresent reporting: <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2014/05/10/day-robot/6UAMgmUFn0mZhoMS8vy0GK/story.html">My Day as a Robot</a>.

We also published an article with the Harvard Cyberlaw Clinic on the [legal and ethical issues surrounding robotic telepresence](http://www.werobot2015.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Matias_Bavitz_Telepresence_We-Robot-Draft-03-27-2015.pdf).
