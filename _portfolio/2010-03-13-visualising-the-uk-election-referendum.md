<p>In 2010, the UK held its first referendum, a vote to reform the way that elections are held in the country. Stef Lewandowski built <a href="http://wrangl.com/">Wrangl</a>, a platform for conducting discussion on the topic</p>
<p>I loved Stef's project and responded with some visualisations of the data coming out of the conversation on Wrangl. Here they are.</p>
<p>The referendum to adopt <a href="http://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/alternative-vote/">the Alternative Voting system</a> failed to pass.</p>
