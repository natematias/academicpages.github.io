<p>While planning for the <a href="http://festival-of-learning.media.mit.edu">2012</a> and <a href="http://fol2013.media.mit.edu">2013</a> Festivals of Learning, we developed a series of designs for discovering what people wanted to teach, learn, and do together.</p>
<p>The <strong>Ideas Board</strong> placed magnetic LEGO cards onto a magnetic whiteboard. Proposers would write a session idea onto the whiteboard to share it. Participants would place a LEGO onto the card to indicate interest in the session.</p>
<hr/>
<p>For the 2013 Festival of Learning, I helped Sayamindu build an open source, online registration system for unconference festivals, inspired by our <a href="http://blog.media.mit.edu/2012/11/making-connections-mozfest-2012.html">experiences at the Mozilla Festival</a>, SourceCamp, and Python conferences.</p>
<p>This project is ongoing. Contact us if you want to use it at your event.</p>
