In 2013, I coordinated the second <strong>Festival of Learning</strong>, a two-day festival where anyone from MIT's Media Lab, Arts/Culture/Technology, and Comparative Media Studies could teach, learn, and collaborate!


Photos from the 2013 event are [here on flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/92496472@N04/).

So long as MIT keeps up the website, you can check out the original site to <a href="http://festival-of-learning.media.mit.edu">learn what happened at the 2012 festival</a>.
