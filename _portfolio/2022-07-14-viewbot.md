title: "Wikipedia View Retrieval Bot"
---

In 2022, CAT Lab started developing a collaboration with WikiWomenInRed, which involved (among other things) retrieving the view counts for a random sample of Wikipedia biographies, based on a [dataset from Rutgers](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/59rey/). To support that, I created a series of scripts to query view counts.

This page is my public documentation for the Wikimedia systems that I am the creator of the code that is querying Wikipedia.
