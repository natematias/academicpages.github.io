<p>I served as the Chief Technology advisor and technical liaison for the Ministry of Stories, a non-profit creative writing centre in East London that helps children and young people to develop their writing. We launched in November 2010, and I served through the Ministry's first year. I set up on-site computer systems, coordinated with contractors for our initial website, recruited a long term tech team, and helped establish the Ministry's online store, <a href="http://www.monstersupplies.org">monstersupplies.org</a>. As of Dec 2012, the Ministry is still thriving and now working to establish a network for creative writing centres across Europe.</p>
<p>We received considerable press upon launch:</p>

<p>I couldn't possibly acknowledge the vast number of amazing people who worked with us on this project, of which I was just one part. Thanks everyone!</p>
