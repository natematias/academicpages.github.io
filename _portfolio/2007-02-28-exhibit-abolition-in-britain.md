 <p>I was technical producer on the exhibit "<a href="http://www.christianheritageuk.org.uk/Publisher/article.aspx?id=75860">Faith &amp; Freedom: Slavery, Abolition, and Wilberforce</a>," which was displayed in the <a href="http://www.christianheritageuk.org.uk/">Round Church Visitor Centre</a> in Cambridge, UK to celebrate the 200th anniversary of abolition. </p>
<p>The research and writing was done by Dominic Vincent, but I did the technical work of creating the DVD and advising on site installation.</p>
