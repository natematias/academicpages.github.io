<p>In "Ethical Explanations: the Ethics of Software Documentation," I argued that the writing of documentation  involves similar ethical responsibilities to <a href="http://litmed.med.nyu.edu/Annotation?action=view&amp;annid=1355">the writing of fiction</a>, or the documenting of government/<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Standard-Code-Parliamentary-Procedure-4th/dp/0071365133/ref=dp_ob_title_bk">public processes</a>. I talked about software development process, translation, and the ethics of choosing writing techniques.</p>
<p>I gave the talk in 2008, when I served on the senior program committee of WikiSym, the International Symposium on Wikis and Open Collaboration. When <a href="http://www.landow.org/">George Landow</a>, <a href="http://www.markbernstein.org/">Mark Bernstein</a>, <a href="http://www.ikiw.org/">Stewart Mader</a>, and I traveled to Porto to plan the conference with <a href="http://www.fe.up.pt/si_uk/funcionarios_geral.formview?p_codigo=231081">Ademar Aguiar</a>, we also gave a half day of talks at <a href="http://www.fe.up.pt/">FEUP</a> and <a href="http://www2.inescporto.pt/">INESC Porto</a> on information management topics.</p>
