CivilServant is an experimentation infrastructure that supports online communities to carry out their own behavioral research, independently of the tech industry. It has been used by communities of millions of people to prevent online harassment, manage misinformation, test ideas for resolving political conflict, and protecting newcomers from online attacks. The software, which I initially developed with Merry Mou as part of my PhD dissertation at the MIT Media Lab Center for Civic Media, is now maintained through the nonprofit I created, also called CivilServant.
