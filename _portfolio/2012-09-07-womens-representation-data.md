In 2012, I worked with Lisa Evans to collect a year-long dataset of news article bylines by women and men publishing in the UK publishers the Guardian, Daily Mail, and Telegraph. This data later became the basis of one part of my Master's thesis at MIT. Lynn Cherny advised on the analysis and charts.

I later used this data in an analysis with Hanna Wallach:
