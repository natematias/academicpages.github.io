  <p>Since I first wrote about <a href="http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox/">Tinderbox</a> by Eastgate Systems in a series on hypertext for SitePoint in 2003, I have been using it for a broad range of information design tasks across academic work, charities, and business.  One of my businesses, <a href="http://emberlight.net">Emberlight</a>, relies on Tinderbox. I have given talks at numerous Tinderbox weekends.</p>
<p>It's very special in the fast-paced technology industry to develop long-term expertise in an area of software. Tinderbox is unusually satisfying in this way, since its flexibility has kept up with my needs.</p>
<p>I have used Tinderbox for information design on hundreds of small projects-- too many to list here. To give you a taste, here are some screenshots of things I have done with Tinderbox which don't appear elsewhere in this portfolio.</p>
