In the Spring of 2010, I was hired by the fashion startup <a href="http://dressipi.com">Dressipi</a> to investigate areas where machine learning could improve their custom style recommendations.</p>
<p>The first step in that process involved developing an initial training dataset. In collaboration with machine learning experts, I developed <b>Sibyl</b>, a software platform which could begin as a tool for collecting training data, and evolve into the recommendation engine itself. </p>
<p>I'm very excited about what Dressipi is doing in the fashion space and can't wait to see how their company evolves in the future.</p>
<p>Here is a screenshot from a <i>very</i> early mockup of the interface:</p>
