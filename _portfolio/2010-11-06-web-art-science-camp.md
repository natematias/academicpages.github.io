<p>In 2010, I led <a href="http://www.webartsciencecamp.org/contact.html">the organising team</a> for <a href="http://www.webartsciencecamp.org/">Web Art Science Camp</a>. We brought together around 30 academics, gradstudents, artists, and business people from across the EU. We also raised over \xa3400 for the <a href="http://sigweb.org/">ACM SIGWEB</a> Student Travel Fund.</p>\r\n<p>Here is our statement of purpose:</p>\r\n<p>Our goals were to:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<ul><li> Connect a wider range of business and society with SIGWEB by holding a conference with limited barriers to entry</li>\r\n<li> Introduce new participants to our field, connecting them with mentors and exposing them to our academic traditions </li>\r\n<li> Generate research and project ideas by holding the event well in advance of major SIGWEB conference submission dates, as well as encouraing demos and idea sharing</li>\r\n<li> Raise money for the SIGWEB Student Travel Fund through ticket sales, making participation affordable for students whose research is successfully published</li>\r\n<li> Build ground support for Web Science by holding an event with the students and academics who will actually do the work of web science-- not just an event for funders and decisionmakers</li>\r\n<li> Document the event for Creative Futures, our sponsor, who aims to connect ideas with innovation in the Paddington region of London</li></ul>\r\n\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p><img width="200" border="1" align="right" src="images/wascamp_report.png"/>As described in <a href="http://emberlight.net/6/webartsci/map">our conference retrospective document</a>, we were significant to some degree in each of these goals.</p>\r\n<ul><li> <a href="http://www.comp.lancs.ac.uk/~dixa/">Alan Dix</a>, coauthor of the HCI book, <a href="http://www.alandix.com/blog/2010/11/06/web-artscience-camp-how-web-killed-the-hypertext-star-and-other-stories/">reviewed Web Art Science Camp</a></li>\r\n<li> <a href="http://www.creative-futures.co.uk/">Creative Futures</a> has published <a href="http://blog.creative-futures.co.uk/2010/11/19/j-nathan-mathias/">a blog interview with me</a> about the event</li>\r\n<li> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/natematias/sets/72157625214905363/">Web Art Science Camp on Flickr</a></li>\r\n<li> I also developed <b>a new way to visualise and report conference outcomes:</b>\r\n<ul><li>  <a href="http://emberlight.net/6/webartsci/map">Web Art Science Camp Retrospective</a> on Emberlight</li>\r\n<li> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/natematias/5199440107/in/set-72157625214905363/">Planning time commitment graph</a></li>\r\n<li> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/emberlight/5191360923/">Visualising conference tweets</a></li></ul></li></ul>\r\n
