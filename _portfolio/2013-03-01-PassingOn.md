title: "Passing On: Crowdsourcing Women's Wikipedia Bios"
uri: 
---

As part of my Master's thesis, I created Passing On with Sophie Diehl. This app reveals the gender disparities in coverage of women's lives in the New York Times obituaries and then uses the data about notable women in the New York Times to organize people to add more women to Wikipedia's coverage of women. 

The project was published as an extended abstract at CHI 2015.
