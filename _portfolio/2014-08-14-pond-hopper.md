In 2014, during my time facilitating 1book140, The Atlantic's Twitter book club, I created <a href="https://github.com/natematias/pond-hopper">Pond Hopper</a>, software that scraped the Atlantic's RSS feed for individual authors and calculated trends in social media metrics for those authors. I used this software to monitor traffic to votes about books and also compare my audience to other writers I admired. I believe several other writers also used the software.
