  <p>While still a student at Cambridge, I was invited by <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/1999/dec/10/bestbooks.classics">Adrian Poole</a> to deliver a lecture to the final year English undergraduate students on the subject of "Tragedy in Electronic Literature" -- as part of the faculty's <a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/guide/ugcourses/english.html">English Tripos</a> lectures, which are normally given by faculty..</p>
<p>In advance of the lecture, <a href="http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/people/cjh06r">Clare Hooper</a>  and I chaired a related panel at the <a href="http://www.sigweb.org/ht07/">2007 annual Hypertext Conference</a>. Panelists were <a href="http://www.rhul.ac.uk/classics/njl/index.html">Nick Lowe</a> (Classics), <a href="http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/people/kmo">Kieron O'Hara</a> (Philosophy), <a href="http://users.ecs.soton.ac.uk/dem/">Dave Millard</a> (Computer Science), and <a href="http://emshort.wordpress.com/">Emily Short</a> (Writer and Classicist).</p>

<p>My lecture at Cambridge, which also included live demos:</p>
<ul><li> Introduced Electronic Literature</li>
<li> Compared the development of literary technique in 5th century Athens to the early development of electronic literature</li>
<li> Examined attempts by writers and academics to appropriate "Tragedy" into electronic literature</li>
<li> Considered examples of what might be Tragedy in Electronic Literature</li></ul>

<p>While listening to my talk, students could also browse a single-purpose WIFI network with additional notes and resources.</p>
