<a href="http://opengendertracking.github.io/about.html">Open Gender Tracker</a> is an open source library for inferring the likely sex of a name based on census records from a given country. This project, funded by Knight Foundation and implemented by Irene Ros and Adam Hyland of Bocoup, involved creating open source software that would take input from a news organization's archive, analyze the bylines and news sources, and provide per-topic visualizations of the gender ratio of bylines and content in the publication.

This software was used widely for a range of journalistic and academic purposes, including my Master's thesis on gender disparities in the news, social media, and Wikipedia, research by the <a href="https://mediacloud.org/">MediaCloud</a> team at Harvard, and a Texas tribune data investigation on the <a href"https://www.texastribune.org/2014/03/21/gender-wage-gap-state-agencies/">gender wage gap in state agencies</a>.
