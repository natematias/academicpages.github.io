<p>Wittgenstein's <i>Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</i> is an important design artifact, since has been put in digital and hypertext form many times. However, most of these designs have been carried out in isolation.</p>
<p>How have designers envisioned digital editions of Wittengstein's unusually-structured work of philosophy, the <i>Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</i>?<b> What scope remains for novel digital design approaches to reading and understanding philosophy texts?</b></p>
<p>My collaborator David Williams (who studies maths and philosophy at the University of Cambridge) asked me to join him on <a href="http://www.natematias.com/proj/tractatus/hacktatus/">the Hacktatus project</a> to find out. Thus far, we have completed:</p>

<ul><li> A <a href="http://www.natematias.com/proj/tractatus/hacktatus/index/Currentdigitaleditionsof.html">design review of digital editions of Wittenstein's Tractatus</a></li>
<li> A prototype anti-design called "<a href="http://www.natematias.com/proj/tractatus/oblique/">The Oblique Tractatus</a>." This working code demonstrates the opposite of the design values which we think should go into the Tractatus.</li>
<li> Designs and prototypes for a digital edition which is intended to serve the needs of serious study rather than casual browsing of the Tractatus structure.</li>
<li> A videogame design concept based on the theory of reality and language expressed within the Tractatus</li></ul>
<p>Here are some images from the Hacktatus project, which is ongoing.</p>
