<p>In 2012, I coordinated the first <a href="http://festival-of-learning.media.mit.edu">Festival of Learning</a>,  a two-day festival where anyone from MIT's  Media Lab, Arts/Culture/Technology, and Comparative Media Studies could teach, learn, and collaborate!</p>

<p>Check out our <a href="http://festival-of-learning.media.mit.edu/node/32">EPIC LIST OF FESTIVAL SESSIONS</a>, with photos, slides, source code, blog posts, and descriptions for everything that happened!</p>

<p>Also check out the videos below and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/fol12/">our Flickr group</a> to see what happened. We made mochi, painted faces, learned CAD, sang two notes at once, played MMOs, built fighter kites, filled a balloon room, discussed research methods, and much much more :-)</p>

<p>Thanks so much to the organising team, as well as LEGO, who donated <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sayamindu/6780351095/in/pool-fol12">hundreds minifigs</a> to festival participants, and to the Media Lab Student Committee, who funded the Festival. Thanks also to the amazing session leaders and everyone who stayed to clear up. You're all awesome!</p>
