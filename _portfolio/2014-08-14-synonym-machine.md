The Synonym Machine downloads famous works of literature and replaces specified parts of speech with random synonyms. The script is currently configured to do this with Moby Dick, in reaction to Robin Sloan's <a href="https://medium.com/message/the-moby-dick-variations-14d61617f1d5">fascinating question</a>: if you replaced every adjective with a close synonym, would it be fair to call this new text by the same title?

<a href="https://github.com/natematias/the-synonym-machine">Source code for the Synonym Machine</a> is available on github.
