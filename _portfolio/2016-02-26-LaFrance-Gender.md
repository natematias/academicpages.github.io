Over a three year period, I provided Adrienne LaFrance with periodic updates on the gender ratio of people she mentioned in her articles. Adrienne wrote about it in the following articles:

Ed Yong later credited this work as a major influence on his own efforts to broaden the percentage of women he covers in his reporting.
