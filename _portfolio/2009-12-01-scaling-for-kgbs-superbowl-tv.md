title: Scaling for kgb's Superbowl TV Ad
uri: ''
---

<p.In 2010, I was part of the team which scaled the SMS microwork service of the <a href="http://superbowl.kgb.com/">Knowledge Generation Bureau</a> for the television ad we ran during the American Super Bowl (along with others that day). That year, the Super Bowl had 106.5 million television viewers.</p>
<p>Since the kgb service is carried out by thousands of people working <i>collaboratively</i> on our web app, scaling our system was significantly more challenging than simply scaling a website or web application with limited collaboration.</p>
<p>My role involved:</p>
<ul><li> Developing and coordinating distributed, cloud-based simulations of worker activity in order to:
<ul><li> Establish what our ordinary architecture was capable</li>

<li> Advise the business on possibilities for the ad campaign</li>
<li> Give the business information it could use to decide if it should approve the ad campaign</li>
<li> Provide the tech team with the information it needed to decide a scaling approach</li>
<li> Run simulated performance tests as part of the development and deployment process of scaling and testing our new architecture</li></ul></li>
<li> Briefing our technology partners on the superbowl project, what our plans for scaling were, and discussing how to coordinate our efforts</li></ul>
<p>I wrote an article on one aspect of this project for RailsInside: "<a href="http://www.railsinside.com/case-studies/421-kgb-scaling-superbowl-traffic-case-study.html">How a Realtime SMS Service Scaled to Super Bowl Traffic with Rails</a>."</p>
