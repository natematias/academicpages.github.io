title: "Reviewer Allocator"
---

Do you need to assign reviewers to applicants in some kind of decision-making process? I wrote this code to streamline a few reviewer allocation processes in my own work, and I have published this github repository to have a single place to document that code.

This software converts the problem of reviewer allocation into a "min-cost flow" optimization problem. It's not novel in any way. If you took an undergrad course in advanced algorithms or optimization, this would be a basic technique, and you might have better ways to solve this problem.
