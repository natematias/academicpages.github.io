<p><a href="http://www.rubberpaw.com/philadelphia/">Philadelphia Fullerine</a> is a geodesic narrative montage showing people, events, and themes of ethnic life in mid-19th century Philadelphia. Each face, which presents an image from Philadelphia history, has a corresponding audio narrative. The stories and ideas of adjacent faces are related, and may be followed to explore connected narratives.</p>
<p>A multidisciplinary project, Philadelphia Fullerine brought together my skills in sculpture, engineering, hypertext history research, writing, performance, and recording.</p>

<ul><li> A  handcrafted, rotating geodesic sphere &amp; digital exhibit (<a href="http://www.rubberpaw.com/philadelphia/">project site</a>)</li>

<li> A Video + Audio Multimedia DVD for computers (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/natematias/5236250510/in/photostream/">screenshot here</a>)</li>
<li> A linear narrative submitted as my senior thesis in the English Department at Elizabethtown College</li></ul>
