In 2015, I organized GenderData4Change, a gathering of data scientists with organizations working on gender equality to imagine ways to use data to create change. This event, hosted at the Microsoft NYC offices, was funded by the Knight Foundation and co-facilitated by Willow Brugh and colleagues at DataKind. While the details of the event are private, I can say that several of the projects imagined at the workshop were implemented and went on to create meaningful impact in industry and society.

Here are some of my slides from the event:
