<p>Emberlight puts visual notes online, as a collaboration server and web publishing platform for spatially-related, linked documents.</p>
<p>I founded the company together with Frederick Cheung, former Chief Wizard at <a href="TexpertsandtheKnowledgeG.html">Texperts/KGB</a> and now CTO of <a href="DressipiSibyl.html">Dressipi</a>. We develop it in the evenings and weekends.</p>
<p>I'm very proud of Emberlight, which has grown out of my computer science research.</p>
<p>Emberlight has been used in American community colleges to enable writing and computer science students to work on team projects in their first year. </p>
<p><strong>Emberlight ceased operations when I moved to the MIT Media Lab in 2011</strong>. When the company ceased operations, Emberlight was being used by many teams and individuals including some at:</p>

<ul><li> The Art Institute of Chicago</li>
<li> Goldsmith's University</li>
<li> VMWare Cloud</li>
<li> The British Institute of Physics</li>
<li> Tunxis Community College</li></ul>
<p>Emberlight aimed to be an innovative company. Here are a few of the technical things Fred and I are most proud of:</p>

<ul><li> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/natematias/3901338109/">A Functional Testing Framework for HTML5 Canvas</a> (Summer 2009)</li>
<li> Extending HTML to support <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/natematias/4100500044/in/set-72157621921932346/">overlapping links</a></li>
<li> Extending HTML to support <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/natematias/4100437839/in/set-72157621921932346/">highlighted link targets</a></li>
<li> Developing a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/natematias/5030119857/in/set-72157621921932346/">touchscreen UI</a> for spatial hypertext</li></ul>

<p>In the summer of 2009, Fred and I made a video pitch for Innovate10 competition. Although our business model has changed significantly  since then, the video still provides a useful overview of our software and how it fits into the market.</p>
