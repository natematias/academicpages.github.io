<p>Having heard an excellent talk in early 2008 by the team at <a href="http://www.egovplus.dk/nyt/nyheder08/egov.htm">EGov+ in Denmark</a>, I have developed an ongoing interest in the use of document-rich collaborative timelines to help citizens and bureaucracies coordinate paperwork-intences processes.</p>
<p>I gave a talk about "<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/natematias/timelines-for-casework-collaboration-with-citizens">timelines for casework collaboration</a>" in 2008 at BarCamp Transparency in Oxford.</p>
<p>Since then, I have prototyped this approach with my own immigration application in the UK. Toward a more complete test, I have negotiated a memorandum of understanding with a German university to do a trial in the EU, and we're currently looking for a local government and grant funding to take this project forward.</p>
<p><strong>Update, Dec 2012</strong>. Having moved to Boston to join the Center for Civic Media, I no longer had time to pursue this project. In retrospect, I would probably try to re-imagine this project with more accessible technology.</p>
