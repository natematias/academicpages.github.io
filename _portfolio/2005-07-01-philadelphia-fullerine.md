<p>In addition to building the <a href="http://www.rubberpaw.com/philadelphia/">Philadelphia Fullerine</a> documentary, I submitted a research paper to the <a href="http://www.ht05.org/">2005 ACM sigweb Hypertext conference</a>. They accepted my paper and invited me to speak at the conference in Salzburg. My paper was runner-up for the Engelbart award for Best Paper and received the Nelson Award for best newcomer paper. </p>
<p>Since winning that award, I have continued an ongoing involvement in sigweb and the ACM. </p>

<p>Here is the abstract:</p>
<blockquote>Philadelphia Fullerine, a geodesic hypermedia sculpture designed by the author, is about ethnic and lower class life in mid-19th century Philadelphia. Each of the 60 faces presents primary image material and a short audio documentary. Adjacent faces are linked conceptually. This geodesic sphere has full rotational freedom. Viewers are encouraged to begin anywhere and follow any path of adjacency. This paper examines the underlying theory, design methods, and structure of the sculpture as a case study in the applications and challenges of creating, storing, and navigating three-dimensional hyperstructures with spatial hypertext software and GZigZag.</blockquote>
