> Today, maple sap flows like a stream of water with only a trace of sweetness to remind the people both of possibility and of responsibility

Are the winter blues getting at you too after months of freezing gray, and damp weather? This March, I'm getting outdoors for a celebration of fire, forests, and sugar by riding my bicycle to visit local maple producers and learn more about the land where I live. It's a great way to get outside, meet neighbors, and indulge on a special treat.

I'm inviting you to join as well, and to share your experience with the people in your life, on social media or off (optional hashtag #MapleAdventure). Here's how it works:

* Look up your region's Maple Weekend (see below)
* Do one thing to learn about maple, its history, and its meanings (reading & watching suggestions below)
* Ride your bicycle at least 1 mile, to a local maple operation with an open house, or a shop/stand that sells local maple
  * It could be your local co-op such as Green Star here in Ithaca, though I think you'll have more fun if it's not a supermarket
* Taste something made with maple!
* Share your story with the people in your life
  * Optional: post on social media, using the hashtag #MapleAdventure
  * If you post to Instagram or Mastodon/Fediverse, I will share it too

## About my ride

> Walking lines is a constant ritual in sugaring... it is the intersection of the natural and the cultural that is really being brought under the eye.

I'm an ultra-endurance cyclist and writer who explores landscape and history on two wheels. Last year, my friend Ivan and I [bicycled 550 miles in the footsteps of the Farmworker movement](https://natematias.com/portfolio/2023-06-01-cycling-central-valley/) to trace the origin of an orange I ate at Christmas in my grocery store in central New York. This year, I'm riding closer to home on a ride to visit maple producers and think about my relationship to land, community, and forests where I live.

My plan is to ride at least 250 miles over two days, visiting and meeting maple producers across New York, fueled by maple syrup and sugar that I pick up along the way. I'm currently finalizing where to visit and who to interview, while also testing different recipes for maple-based energy drink I can make on the road. My plan is to ride on New York's Maple Weekend, March 16-17, with a backup date of March 22-23 if the weather is unsafe.

## Design your own ride
People have been so excited about the Maple Adventure, that I decided to invite others to join in by making your own route and posting a photo of yourself on you adventure. I'm especially grateful to Chasing Mailboxes for inspiration. For several years now, they have organized a ["Coffeeneuring" adventure](https://chasingmailboxes.com/category/coffeeneuring/coffeeneuring-rules/) every November for people to visit local coffeeshops on their bicycles. Their [Coffeeneurs](https://www.facebook.com/groups/335575683253788) group offers a wonderfully-inclusive space for people of all abilities and interests to get outdoors, enjoy the fresh air, and celebrate together online.

### Learning about Maple
Here are some stories and books that I've found especially meaningful while preparing for the ride:

I really love Robin Wall Kimmerer's chapters about maple in the book Braiding Sweetgrass; they're beautiful and inspiring:
* Maple Sugar Moon, which describes indigenous sugar-making traditions and the science of maple sugar
* Maple Nation: A Citizenship Guide, which asks what it means to have "maple in your bloodstream, maple in your bones."

Maple sugaring started with Indigenous American groups long before Europeans arrived in the US. Here in New York state, some indigenous communities have been regaining access to stolen ancestral lands and harvesting maple on those lands. I deeply appreciate Gabriel Pietrorazio's article about this trend, and for his willingness to speak with me as I planned the Maple Adventure.

If you're more of a podcast person, I think you'll enjoy Sweet Talk ([Apple](https://podcasts.apple.com/sk/podcast/sweet-talk-all-things-maple/id1546134868?l=sk), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/4Ii7SOx3RLXKeH1bHhSmzg)), the Cornell Maple program's regular podcast. I especially enjoyed the episode in March 2022 about urban sugaring, and a series of [episodes about Maple in sport science](https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/maple-program/episodes/Episode-6-Sweet-Talk-with-Dr--Tremblay---Maple-and-Human-Health-Part-II-Human-Clinical-Trials-e13qssj).

### Preparing for winter bicycling
You will know your own local conditions better than anyone, but if you're less used to riding in cold or icy conditions, here are a few helpful links:

* (Shifter)(video) [Simple and affordable ways to ride a bike through winter with stuff you already own](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4oo_UE8lPY)
* Kenins, L (2019) [How winter cyclists can stay safe on the roads](https://www.cbc.ca/life/culture/experts-on-how-winter-cyclists-can-stay-safe-on-the-roads-1.4981180). Canadian Broadcasting Company

I'm planning to wear lots of wool!

### Fueling your ride with maple syrup
When I told a friend it would could take me up to a half gallon of Maple syrup to ride from Ithaca to Lake Placid, she got a bit wide-eyed. To anyone who's not an endurance athlete, this won't be a surprise. At my pace, a 250-300 mile ride will easily involve 20-24 hours of elapsed ride time and use ten to twelve thousand calories. Much of this will need to come from carbohydrates at the pace I ride.

If you're planning a longer ride, I expect you'll know how to manage nutrition. But maple might be new to you. I have found Cody Beals's [guide to homebrew maple + maltodextrin energy drink to be very helpful](https://www.codybeals.com/2013/06/endurance-eats-homebrew-sport-drink/). This recipe takes advantage of multiple pathways for carbohydrate absorption and includes electrolytes. 

I also encourage you to train your gut to digest whatever you make — I'm planning to do several extended rides to see how long I can sustain a strong pace. With Maple's lower glycemic index, I'll admit to being a bit unsure I will be able to sustain a strong effort once I start climbing into the Adirondacks. Unfortunately the only [randomized trials for maple energy drinks](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1186/s12970-020-00384-3) are based on hour-long time trials rather than ultra-endurants events.

If you're planning a shorter ride or e-bike adventure, I suggest tasting a tablespoon or so of maple sugar at each place you visit— that's roughly 50-55 calories. Though there's no reason not to indulge!
