<p>In the summer of 2010, Steve Ersinghaus convinced me to conduct an extended creative experiment in visual rhetoric: create one visual summary per day as long as possible. The project has been leading me to think more broadly about spatial hypertext-- beyond its role as personal information manager, toward a role in communication. </p>
<p>These were all done with <a href="http://eastgate.com/Tinderbox/">Tinderbox</a> and <a href="http://emberlight.net/">Emberlight</a>.</p>
