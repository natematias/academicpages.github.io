<p>What do you call a cross between Tinkertoys, K'Nex, Gears, wooden blocks and a plastic boat? My friend Eric Rosenbaum and I are trying to find out.  We're inspired by Golan Levin and Shawn Sims's <a href="http://fffff.at/free-universal-construction-kit/">Free Universal Construction Kit</a>, which allows anyone with a 3D printer to connect previously-incompatible construction toys. We love that Golan and Shawn released their designs with a Creative Commons license, but 3D printers remain far too expensive for most poeple.</p>

<p>The Toy Interface Construction Kit Learning Environment (T.I.C.K.L.E.) is a universal construction kit for the rest of us. It doesn't require 3D printers or CAD skills. Instead, we're using <a href="http://sugru.com/">Sugru</a>, a self-setting rubber material.</p>
