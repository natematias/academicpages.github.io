<p>Have you ever found yourself in a conversation which followed too many rabbit trails? Have you ever read an article which did the same? What if you could have digressions and concise style in the same document?</p>
<p>My StretchText writing system, based on research by <a href="http://fagerjord.no/">Anders Fagerjord</a> and inspiration from <a href="http://ted.hyperland.com/">Ted Nelson</a>, made it easy for non-technical authors to generate stretchtext documents. It featured:</p>
<ul><li> Expanding/collapsing paragraphs</li>
<li> Expanding illustrations with captions</li>

<li> Contextual marginal notes</li>
<li> Expanding quotations which show more of the context when you click on them</li></ul>
<p>Mark Bernstein once mentioned to me that his paper "<a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1557920">On Hypertext Narration</a>" was encouraged by this project.</p>
<p>A sample stretchtext document is available at <a href="http://natematias.com/stretchtext/">natematias.com/stretchtext</a>.</p>
