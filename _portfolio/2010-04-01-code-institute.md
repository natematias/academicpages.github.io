<p>In 2010, I did business development for the CoDE Institute at Anglia Ruskin University, in Cambridge UK.</p>

<blockquote><p>CoDE is a network of academics working in media theory and network culture, media archaeology, digital music and video, fine arts, video games, production and performance, serious gaming and digital text, combined with scientific contributions from colleagues involved with design and technology, audio engineering and computer design and animation</p>.

<p>Its key emerging research areas include social media and network politics, digital performance and production, digital humanities and play and serious gaming.</p></blockquote>

<p>At the CoDE Institute, I met with faculty to discover new research collaboration ideas, meet up with companies to discuss partnership ideas, and support a broad range of initiatives to share the work of CoDE throughout the tech, design, and games industry.</p>
