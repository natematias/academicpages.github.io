I have mixed feelings towards this hypertext about nonfiction form on the Web, which I presented at Rose-Hulman's 10th anniversary of the Web conference: WWW@10. </p>
<p>"What will web creative nonfiction look like?" is the driving question of this hypertext essay. It includes analyses of:</p>
<ul><li> Two museums</li>
<li> Several book-length creative nonfictions</li>
<li> Television &amp; film documentaries</li>

<li> Several nonfiction websites</li></ul>
<p>Looking back, I appreciate its breadth and love its rhetorical innovation. I cringe at the low quality of its analysis. Nevertheless, I can see that creating this paper has profoundly shaped the later development of <a href="http://www.rubberpaw.com/philadelphia/">Philadelphia Fullerine</a> and the World University Project. It also gave me the confidence to work on the <a href="#">Antislavery Exhibit in Cambridge</a> several years later.</p>
