<p>Grassroots Mobile is a a power strip that makes it easy for people to sell electricity to their neighbours. It incorporates automatic metering with mobile payments.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2012, Matt Stempeck, Ethan Zuckerman and I carried out some  <a href="http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/2012/07/10/kenya-power-and-questioning-my-assumptions/">initial field research</a> to scope out the project.</p> 

<p>In the autumn of 2012, Pragun Goyal and I built the first prototype. We're now hoping to test a version 0.2 in the summer of 2013.</p>

<ol>
<li>Plug your cord into the strip</li>
<li>Use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-Pesa">M-Pesa</a> to text money to the strip</li>
<li>The power strip texts you back telling you how much power you now have</li>
<li>When you're close to running out, the power strip texts you and eventually shuts off the power</li>
</ol>
