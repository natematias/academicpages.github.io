<p>As a fun exercise, I recently mapped out the graph of mailing list membership at the MIT Media Lab, where I am a research assistant. After I filtered out the tiniest lists, the graph contains 23372 email addresses and 44109 edges. Red dots are mailing lists. Grey dots are individual email addresses.</p>

<p>The overall graph shows several distinct patterns:</p>
<ul><li>The large amorphous cluster on the right is comprised of MIT Media Lab faculty, staff, and students.</li>
<il>The blue dot is the famous foodcam. The pink dot is the backchannel for sharing cool links.</li>
<li>On the left are email lists used for sponsor relations. Almost all of the emails in the leftmost cluster include representatives of the companies we work with.</li>
<li>The beautiful cluster at the top is a conference, the International Symposium on Display Holography, which is being managed with an MIT Media Lab mailing list. Like the parachute-like clusters, it's a mailing list whose participants are mostly outside the lab.</li>
</ul>
