<p>A dissertation proposing literary criticism of choice in Interactive Fiction. This project has also resulted in:</p>\r\n<ul><li> A talk on "<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/natematias/moral-choiceininteractivefiction-wascamplondon">Moral Choice in Interactive Fiction</a>" at Web Art Science Camp 2011</li>\r\n<li> A new project to develop a web-based microwork narrative psychology research framework. Literary scholars and psychologists could use this framework to gather metrics on their readers\' choices</li>\r\n<li> A formal technique for citing and accessing cited "interactions" in interactive fiction</li></ul>\r\n\r\n<p>In the big picture, my dissertation established an approach to literary criticism of interactive fiction which is compatible with criticism of plays and other non-interactive forms. The dissertation </p>\r\n<ul><li> provided an overview of <b>choice in interactive fiction</b></li>\r\n<li> explained <b>the value to criticism </b>of literary choice</li>\r\n<li> outlined <b>the value to psychology and philosophy</b> of an experimentally-valid approach to literary choice </li>\r\n\r\n<li> proposed <b>a definition for "Literary Choice"</b> in iteractive fiction</li>\r\n<li> provided <b>sample criticism</b> to demonstrate the explanatory power of literary choice</li></ul>\r\n<a title="A slide from &quot;Moral Choice in Interactive Fiction&quot; by J.

This is a serious charge which is a significant setback to the science of mind. While the Moral Sense Test is not in question, I plan to collaborate with colleagues in late 2010 to duplicate Hauser\x92s experiment and test its validity (see above, about a microwork experimental platform).</li></ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Update</strong>: After joining the MIT Media Lab, I had to discontinue my work to create an online gameplay research framework.
