In 2016, I was on the organizing team for <a href="http://www.uniteboston.com/bostons-christians-use-technology-for-world-missions/">Indigitous #Hack Boston</a>, held at the MIT Media Lab. In this weekend gathering of Christian designers, engineers, and data scientists with Christian organizations, we worked in parallel with Christians in 40 other cities around the world to imagine ways that technology could come together with our faith.

Other organizers included Ken Arnold, Susan Arnold, Matt Carroll, and Ryan McReynolds. Global organizers were Ali Llewellyn and Nick Skytland.
