<p>Although my major at Elizabethtown College was English, and my minor was Computer Science, I spent most of my time in the music department. The Fine and Performing Arts Department generously permitted me to hold a senior performance recital, a privilege ordinarly reserved for music majors.</p>
<p>At the time, my instructor was <a href="http://www.jeffreywohlbach.com/">Jeffrey Wohlbach</a>, who still travels with the <a href="http://www.glennmillerorchestra.com/">Glenn Miller Orchestra</a>.</p>
<p>A friend was able to some of the audio from a home video:</p>
