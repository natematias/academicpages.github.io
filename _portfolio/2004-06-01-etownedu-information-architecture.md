<p>In the summer of 2004, I was asked to work as an information architect on the <a href="http://etown.edu">Elizabethtown College</a> website redesign project.</p>
<p>This project won the highest functionality rating possible from the US National Research Center for College University Admissions. The award was specifically focused on information architecture: "Grades were earned based on the ability of a college or university admissions website to take students from a prospect to applicant." </p>
 <p>My role involved:</p>
<ul><li> Aggregating all of the existing information about college programs, in print and digital form</li>
<li> Integrating the website with the datasources used to generate the printed catalogs</li>

<li> Designing the information flow through Etown's online catalog</li>
<li> Refactoring large parts of our old website, in a way which preserved the website's existing links and search engine results</li>
<li> Developing a prototype content management system for copy editors to  work on</li>
<li> Managing a team of students to copy edit the new site</li></ul>
<p>Here are some screenshots of my designs for the site information architecture:</p>

<p>The 2004 design for that site no longer exists, but I occasionally notice sections which retain the old structure and code.</p>
