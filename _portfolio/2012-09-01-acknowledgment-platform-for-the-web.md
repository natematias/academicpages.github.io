<p>I'm incredibly lucky and happy to participate in <a href="/us">a wonderful network</a> of people, communities, and inspiration-- a network that includes my readers as well. This portfolio site offers an attempt to acknowledge that amazing family for the generosity, enthusiasm, and relationship of our creative collaborations. </p>

<p>It's also test software for a larger initiative to redesign how acknowledgment works on the web. I started this project during an independent study with Mitchel Resnick as a Master's student at the MIT Media Lab. For more information read my post on <a href="http://civic.mit.edu/blog/natematias/designing-acknowledgment-on-the-web">Designing Acknowledging For the Web</a>.
