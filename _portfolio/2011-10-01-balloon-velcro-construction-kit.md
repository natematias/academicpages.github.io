<p>Throughout the autumn of 2011, Jason Haas and I experimented with ways to use balloons as construction materials in the spirit of LEGO.</p>
<p>We attached balloons to each other with adhesive velcro strips and tried to build large structures with them. We also held a play-testing session with the entire Media Lab.</p>
<p>Making structures with balloons offers opportunities to construct objects larger than any single person, and to attach individual parts by looking through the semi-transparent balloons.</p>
<p>In playtesting, we noticed that many people feel very tentative about building with balloons. They're hard to inflate and people have strong phobias against popping.</p>
