I study digital governance and behavior change in groups and networks shaped by algorithms. I collaborate with the public in citizen behavioral science, working for a world where digital power is guided by evidence and accountable to the public.

<p>I am an assistant professor at the Cornell University Department of Communication, where I lead the <a href="https://citizensandtech.org">Citizens &amp; Technology Lab</a> (<a href="bio/">full bio here</a>).</p>

### Guide for Journalists &amp; Event Organizers

As someone who regularly [gives keynotes](/speaking/), appears on panels, and commits acts of journalism, I do what I can to support high quality conversation on tech and society: as a speaker, as a source, and by helping you find experts. I also collaborate with journalists on data journalism projects related to tech companies, their policies, and online behavior. To invite me to give a talk, see my page about [talks and speaking](/speaking/).

Reach out if I can help; over the last few years I have supported journalists on background, with suggested sources, statistics feedback, and served as a named source for journalists from the New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, ProPublica, The Markup, NPR All Things Considered, WIRED, The Atlantic, The Guardian, Boston Globe, Canadian Broadcasting Company, FastCompany, Fortune, Chronicle of Higher Education, Nieman Journalism Review, and the Columbia Journalism Review, to name a few.

<!--I have spoken at TED, Aspen, Wikimania, the Mozilla Festival, the Veritas Forum, and many universities around the world. I have given invited talks at tech firms including Twitter, Microsoft, Facebook, Reddit, Disqus, and others. I and my work have been covered by the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, the Guardian, NPR's All Things Considered, the Canadian Broadcasting Company, FastCompany, the Boston Globe, and more.-->
