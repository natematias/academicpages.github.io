Are you a PhD student interested to join the [Citizens and Technology Lab](https://citizensandtech.org) (CAT Lab)? This page explains more about what we do, what I'm looking for, and what you need to know to apply.

I am recruiting students for the Ithaca-based PhD programs in **Communication** and **Information Science**:

* [Communication PhD Admissions information](https://cals.cornell.edu/communication/graduate/admissions-financial-support) (Deadline Dec 1st). Apply to this program if you are excited to advance theory and practice in the social sciences and social policy (tending toward social psychology)
* [Information Science PhD Admissions](https://infosci.cornell.edu/phd/admissions) (Deadline Dec 1st). Apply to this program if you are excited to advance theory and practice related to justice/ethics in technology accountability and the design of data science systems

When applying, please name me in your cover letter so I see your application.

## Why I'm Recruiting PhD Students
Society needs leaders [who can make evidence-based progress](https://natematias.medium.com/why-im-going-on-the-academic-job-market-88caa704c8e1) towards fairer, safer, more understanding digital environments. At CAT Lab, we are creating a community for people to grow into those leaders, whether you go into academia, civil society, government, or industry.

For guidance on where else to apply, see my post: "[So you want to study technology, democracy, and social change?](https://natematias.medium.com/so-you-want-to-study-technology-democracy-and-social-change-9ef3e73fa635)"

## About CAT Lab
At CAT Lab, we are advancing a world where digital power is guided by evidence and accountable to the public. We do this by working directly with communities affected by digital power on research that:

* makes a **practical difference** in people's lives
* advances **scientific knowledge** 
* contributes to **policy**


We are distinctive for [developing our research agendas directly with affected communities](https://www.insidehighered.com/advice/2021/04/22/identifying-research-topics-will-not-only-advance-science-also-improve-broader). If you are excited about making knowledge-creation in computing and the social sciences [more inclusive, diverse, and democratic](https://natematias.com/media/Community_Led_Experiments-CHI_2018.pdf), we are the lab for you.

CAT Lab typically takes on three **kinds of projects**:

* Research studies / audits that contribute to the social sciences, especially focused on human-algorithm behavior and the psychology of social norms ([example](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/16/e2013833118.short))
* Computer science papers on novel datasets or systems/algorithms we develop to support those studies ([example 1](https://jonathanzong.com/assets/papers/automated-debriefing-cscw-2018.pdf), [example 2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-021-00934-7))
* Projects in computer science and the social sciences that broaden diversity through citizen science and public engagement ([example](https://citizensandtech.org/research/n-of-one-trials/))
* Big-picture articles that summarize or argue an important point to academics, civil society, and policymakers ([example](https://just-tech.ssrc.org/field-reviews/impact-assessment-of-human-algorithm-feedback-loops/))

CAT Lab's funding model is [independent from the technology industry](https://citizensandtech.org/2020/01/industry-independent-research/), which frees us to do public-interest work whether or not companies find our results comfortable.

* Learn more about [CAT Lab Research](https://citizensandtech.org/research/)
* Meet [the CAT Lab team](https://citizensandtech.org/about-cat-lab/)

Individual CAT Lab members have a history of organizing advocacy related to the topics we study, as well as justice issues in higher education.

## What kind of applicants am I looking for?
I am equally interested in applicants:
 
* with a track record in social sciences (especially experiments) and/or computing
* who want to transition into those fields and can demonstrate your motivations/potential for making that transition

For more guidance on Communication and Information Science, please see guidance on [Communication PhD admissions](https://cals.cornell.edu/communication/graduate/admissions-financial-support) and [Information Science PhD admissions](https://infosci.cornell.edu/phd/admissions) for more details.

## What will you work on?
One purpose of the PhD is to support your personal growth toward your own ideas and initiatives that you imagine and put into the world. 

Along the way, you will receive mentorship from me and community from CAT Lab, your department, and Cornell. Joining CAT Lab means accepting the idea that our research agenda is [co-developed with community partners](https://www.insidehighered.com/advice/2021/04/22/identifying-research-topics-will-not-only-advance-science-also-improve-broader). 

Some of your early projects will likely come out of the lab's existing relationships and commitments. Over time as a lab member, we will support you to develop novel projects alongside communities. You will also have many opportunities to develop collaborations with other faculty and students at Cornell.

We are currently working on projects involving:

* developing scientific theories to explain and govern human-algorithm feedback
* improving online dialog and knowledge creation (social norms)
* strengthening participation and discourse by marginalized voices
* improving civic discourse during political conflict (social norms)
* scaling citizen science audits of digital power
* governing encrypted chat systems in democratic ways

## How will you be funded?
As a PhD student, you can expect to be fully funded during the standard PhD length so long as you are in good academic standing. Here are the sources of funding you will have available to you as a PhD student:

* [Funding in Communication](https://cals.cornell.edu/communication/graduate/admissions-financial-support)
* [Funding in Information Science](https://infosci.cornell.edu/phd/admissions)

Because CAT Lab is an industry-independent research lab, we have fewer funding sources than other labs. Despite that, the lab has led or participated in over 6 million dollars in grants and donations since its founding. While most of these funds support CAT Lab's [professional staff, community organizers, and software systems](https://citizensandtech.org/about-cat-lab/), we can also fund semesters as research assistants on pre-existing projects.

When I was a PhD student, the art of fundraising was one of the most valuable skills I learned from my advisor [Ethan Zuckerman](https://ethanzuckerman.com/). At CAT Lab, you will get mentorship in the strategy and craft of raising funds for academic, nonprofit, and for-profit ventures.

Graduate teaching opportunities will also provide a regular source of your funding. These essential experiences will grow your capacities as a public communicator, institution builder, and designer of equitable systems. Teaching will also prepare you for a possible career in academia. I am eager to advise students who have an appetite for investing in others through teaching.

Cornell also offers several [fellowships in support of diversity](https://gradschool.cornell.edu/diversity-inclusion/funding-and-resources/graduate-school-fellowships-in-support-of-diversity/). If you qualify, please include the required materials in your application, as described by the Communication or Information Science admissions guides.

If you want to apply for graduate fellowships, I will support those applications, including summer internships and funding from technology firms. To avoid penalizing students for exploring valuable industry opportunities, we have a conflict of interest policy. Corporate-funded projects will be done independently from CAT Lab's name/staff/resources. While funded by a company, you will also need to step aside from any CAT Lab project that involves that company, which is pretty standard corporate policy as well.

# Diversity and Inclusion
As a white-passing Guatemalan-American whose family moved to the U.S. during the civil war and genocide, I sit at the confluence of key themes in diversity and inclusion, especially ones related to power and access. Throughout my career, I have worked to support students and institutions to make the most of the world-changing potential of diverse, inclusive participation.

At CAT Lab, we very deliberately structure our outreach/collaborations to be globally and socially diverse. With the help of our collaborators at [Global Voices](https://globalvoices.org/about/), we have also designed our work to include people from many countries speaking many different languages.

In recent years, I have:

  * Helped re-design the graduate admissions process to be more inclusive
  * Led trainings for under-represented minority graduate students on how to have a public voice and manage the risks of harassment
  * Led and supported efforts to change how charitable foundations think and act on funding diversity
  * Re-worked course syllabi to include more readings from a wider range of identities, including perspectives from the Global South
  * Volunteered with initiatives that broaden the pipeline for women and under-represented minorities in higher education

I am especially energized when contributing to projects that support excellence among people who aren't commonly included in academia–people who I am excited to see grow personally as your perspectives and creativity transform your institutions and your fields.

# Questions / Answers
* **Does CAT Lab advise undergraduate students?** Right now CAT Lab is not recruiting new undergraduate research assistants, sorry!
* **Can we meet up before I apply?** If you're thinking about applying, that's a good sign you should apply! To keep things fair for everyone, I have decided not to hold meetings with prospective applicants in advance of the admissions date. I hope this document answers common questions.
* **Can I join CAT Lab from Cornell Tech?** Although CAT Lab meets at Cornell Tech in New York City regularly, I am not currently able to advise PhD students based at Cornell Tech.
