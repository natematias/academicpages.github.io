<p>I frequently give public audience and academic talks. If you are an academic department looking for a colloquium speaker, ask me about a <a href="/publications/">recent publication</a> or one of the following topics:</p>

* The science of governing artificial intelligence ([see my research here](/publications/))
* Community-led field experiments in computing, social-psychology, and technology governance ([examples here](https://citizensandtech.org/research/))
* The importance of independent research on technology and society, and mechanisms to protect it: [the Coalition for Independent Technology Research](https://independenttechresearch.org/about-us/)
* Advancing science through transparency over corporate experiments: The [Upworthy Research Archive](https://upworthy.natematias.com)


<p>In recent years, I have spoken at TED, Aspen, Wikimania, SXSW, the Internet Governance Forum, the Mozilla Festival, the Royal Society of Arts, the Veritas Forum, and many universities around the world.  <!--I have given academic talks at Stanford, Harvard, MIT, Cambridge, Oxford, Princeton, Yale, Columbia, Northeastern, Berkeley, Northwestern, and Francisco Marroquin, to name a few.--> I have given invited talks at tech firms including Twitter, Microsoft, Facebook, Reddit, Disqus, and many others. I also specialize at orchestrating creative events and workshops that foster new ideas and powerful collaborations.</p>


<h3>Scheduling Talks</h3>
<p>To schedule a talk, please send me an email at <em>nathan.matias@cornell.edu</em>. I am available to give talks remotely and have a studio space with high quality video/audio for that purpose.</p>

<p>As a Guatemalan-American who does research and action to advance diverse representation in tech and media, <strong>I decline to participate in all-male or mostly-male events and I can often suggest more diverse speakers</strong>. 

<p>To <a href="https://citizensandtech.org/2020/01/industry-independent-research/">manage conflicts of interest from corporate events</a>, I request that all honoraria and gifts from the technology industry to be sent to the <a href="https://hrdag.org/">Human Rights Data Analysis Group</a> or the <a href="https://www.nwp.org/">National Writing Project</a>.

<h3>Previous Talks & Workshops</h3>
<p>To give you a sense of the range of my speaking, here is a sample of past talks and workshops</p>
