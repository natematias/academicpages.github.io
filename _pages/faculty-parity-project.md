Universities say they're increasing faculty diversity. Is that translating to change overall? Review the data take action, and join the discussion here.

*paper By [J. Nathan Matias](https://natematias.com), [Neil Lewis Jr.](https://neillewisjr.com/), and [Elan Hope](https://www.prainc.com/about-us/our-staff/elan-hope/)*

> U.S. universities have made public commitments to recruit and retain faculty of color. Analysis of three federal datasets shows that at current rates, diversity in U.S. faculty will never reach racial parity. Yet colleges and universities could achieve parity by 2050 by diversifying their faculty at 3.5 times the current pace.

# Supporting Journalists (Including Students) Writing About Faculty Diversity
Are you a journalist interested to write about faculty diversity at your local college/university? Or are you the advisor of a student newspaper? Our team has generated per-institution trend data and are sharing it with local journalists and student journalists who are reporting on faculty diversity questions at your institutions. 

For more information and access to the data, please write us at nathan.matias@cornell.edu and include *[faculty-diversity]* in the subject line.

When you write your story, share the link with us, and we will add it to this page.

# Frequently Asked Questions
We know that faculty diversity is a much-discussed topic across the US and internationally, and we want to engage respectfully with what we expect could be a high volume conversation. To support that conversation, we are posting a Frequently-Asked-Questions document here, which we will update with our answers to common questions.
