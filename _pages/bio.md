Dr. J. Nathan Matias (<a href="https://twitter.com/natematias">@natematias</a>) organizes citizen behavioral science for a safer, farer, more understanding internet. A Guatemalan-American, Nathan is an associate research scholar at Princeton University in psychology, the Center for Information Technology Policy, and sociology.

Nathan is founder of [CivilServant](https://civilservant.io), a nonprofit that organizes citizen behavioral science and behavioral consumer protection research for the internet. CivilServant has worked with communities of tens of millions of people on reddit and Twitter to test ideas for preventing harassment, broadening gender diversity on social media, responding to human/algorithmic misinformation, managing political conflict, and auditing social technologies. Nathan is pioneering industry-independent evaluations on the impact of tech platform policies in society.

In 2017, Nathan completed his Ph.D. at the MIT Media Lab with Ethan Zuckerman on the governance of human and machine behavior in an experimenting society ([video](https://www.media.mit.edu/videos/cm-nathan-matias-defense-2017-05-01/)) ([thesis](https://www.media.mit.edu/publications/governing-human-and-machine-behavior-in-an-experimenting-society/)). Before MIT, Nathan worked in tech startups that have reached over a billion phones, helped start a series of education and journalistic charities, and studied postcolonial literature at the University of Cambridge and Elizabethtown College. His writings have appeared in The Atlantic, PBS, the Guardian, and other international media.
